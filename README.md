# Optimal-Sizing-Small-Scale_MG
Code and data used for my master's thesis and research paper

This research was developed in the framework of the project "DISEÑO E IMPLEMENTACIÓN DE MICRORREDES ELÉCTRICAS PARA GARANTIZAR LA CALIDAD DEL SUMINISTRO EN CARGAS CRÍTICAS DEL VICHADA" developed by Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede: Bogotá and Gobernación del Vichada.

The archives uploaded here serve as support for the research paper "Optimal Design of PV-Storage Microgrids in Healthcare and Governmental Facilities Connected to Highly Intermittent Utility Grids" written as a product of my master's thesis.

Data thesis.xlsx is an excel file containing the parameters and information used in the research

Tesis_Luis_Leon_V_Paper_1.ipynb is a notebook used to solve the sizing problem with the proposed methodology implemented in Python using Pyomo.
